# Website to chatbot
This tool allows you to create a chatbot from your website by converting each page into embeddings and storing them in a Vector database. The embeddings are then used to give OpenAIâ€™s GPT access to information on your website. When a user types in relevant information, their input is converted into embeddings and fed to the vector database. Once the closest matches are found, GPT analyzes the information from the user and the vector database to return a response.

This project was designed for the McKay School of Education. Developed by Derek Vawdrey.
